This plugin helps you check, organize and monitor your broken backlink.



== Description ==
Wordpress Broken Link Manager continuously detects broken backlinks to your website and archives them. If you want, you can be informed by email as soon as a new broken link is detected.

You can either direct all your broken links to a default page or connect them to any page individually.

Method 301, as recommended by Google, is used in the routing process. Thus, you will not suffer from loss by broken links in terms of SEO.

For analysis and reporting, WBLM connects to your web site as 301 and 404, and keeps a record of the users and the boots in the log file. You can follow the data graphically on the dashboard.

You can also create a short link manually to connect to the page you want.

For example: sitemiz.com/tag/wordpress -> siteniz.com/wp


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
