This plugin helps you check, organize and monitor your broken backlink.

== Description ==

Wordpress Broken Link Manager continuously detects broken backlinks to your website and archives them. If you want, you can be informed by email as soon as a new broken link is detected.

You can either direct all your broken links to a default page or connect them to any page individually.

> <strong>SEO Friendly</strong><br>
> Method 301, as recommended by Google, is used in the routing process. Thus, you will not suffer from loss by broken links in terms of SEO.<br>

For analysis and reporting, WBLM connects to your web site as 301 and 404, and keeps a record of the users and the boots in the log file. You can follow the data graphically on the dashboard.

You can also create a short link manually to connect to the page you want.

For example: yourdomain.com/tag/wordpress -> yourdomain.com/wp
